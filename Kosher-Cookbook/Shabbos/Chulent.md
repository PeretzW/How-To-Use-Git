Ingredients
===========
2 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into bite-sized chunks
2 medium onions, cut into bite-sized chunks
1 (2-pound) piece of flanken, cut into 4 to 6 pieces
1/2 tablespoon coarse black pepper
3/4 cup barley
1 cup dried light red kidney beans
3 tablespoons Consommé Mix
2 tablespoons paprika
2 tablespoons honey
1 (1-pound) kishka loaf
3 cups water

Directions
==========
Line bottom of slow cooker with potatoes and onions.
Rinse flanken and pat dry. Place pieces around sides of crock pot, with bones on the outside.
Generously pepper meat.
Add barley and beans. Shake the pot a bit so some of the barley and beans fall into the spaces between the potatoes and onions.
Season with consommé mix, paprika and honey.
Place kishka on top.
Pour in water, adding more if necessary, to completely cover all ingredients.
Cook on low heat overnight, at least 8 hours.
